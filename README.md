## Micrometer Webinar

This is the demo repository used during a STL JUG presentation on Project Micrometer on August 9, 2018.

It consists of a Spring Boot Application (`PersonApplication`) with a couple endpoints, a set of scripts to launch Prometheus and Grafana, and a script to load the `/persons` API endpoint.
